# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## UML Diagram

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Video

Record a short video of your story to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

## Story Description

Write a description of the story that your animation showcases. Give addional context for your story here in the case your animation is more abstract and only has images and little text. Lastly, include what data in your project is represented in 2D arrays and how those directly relate to the story your animation showcase.

The story that my project showcases are four of my favorite things. I chose this because the project is a personal narrative, and these things are a big part of my life. The data that my project represents in 2D arrays is the images of my dog (Luna), my boyfriend, my favorite food, and my favorite hobby. Another data that is stored in a 2d array is the different ways I like to tell people goodbye. These relate to my story that the animation showcases because it shows a personal narrative of my life.

## Image Filter Analysis

Choose at least 2 filters uses in your animation to explain how the pixels are modified. If you created a new image filter that was not one of the ones from this unit, make sure to explain and analyze that filter(s) before choosing ones that came from this unit.



The first filter that I used was Zero red. This filter iterated through the pixels in a certain picture and once it was finished, it set all the pixels it went through with the red value at zero. The next filter that I used was pixelate. This filter used a parameter to determine the size of the new pixels. it found the average color of all the pixels then set the pixels in the surrounding area to be that average.
